# Robot Localization Using HMM-Based Forward Filtering

This repository contains a project on **robot localization** using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** with **forward filtering and forward-backward smoothing** techniques. The goal is to estimate a robot‚Äôs position in a grid environment while handling **sensor failures**.

## üìú Project Overview
### **Objective**
The project aims to localize a robot using **HMM-based filtering** by:
- Implementing **Forward Filtering** for real-time localization.
- Applying **Forward-Backward Smoothing** for enhanced accuracy.
- Comparing **Uniform Failure (UF)** and **Non-Uniform Failure (NUF)** sensor models.
- Evaluating the performance of **HMM-based localization** versus **Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)**.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Used to estimate the robot‚Äôs position based on noisy sensor data.
- **Forward Filtering:** Updates the robot‚Äôs belief about its location over time.
- **Forward-Backward Smoothing:** Uses past and future observations to refine localization accuracy.
- **Sensor Failure Models:** Two types of sensor failures are considered:
  - **Non-Uniform Failure (NUF)**: Some grid positions have higher failure rates.
  - **Uniform Failure (UF)**: All positions have the same failure probability.
